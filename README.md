# 2D_axial-symmetry_plane-strain_dealii
Proposal of a framework and functions to handle 2D computations such as axial symmetry or plane strain in deal.ii

## ToDo
* add some notes on plane stress: standard approach of iterations, and possibly more advanced schemes from recent publications
* Add a simple code that uses the functions in the correct order with a Doxygen documentation. E.g. expand on step-3 using the Rod ([Numerical examples in deal.ii](https://github.com/jfriedlein/Numerical_examples_in_dealii)) in 2D and 3D.
* Try using the class DataOutRotation (https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/classDataOutRotation.html) that can rotate the 2D results around the z-axis to output 3D results.
* Implementation: The functions get_JxW etc. require the FEValues Updateflag "update_quadrature_points"
* Option to choose the rotation axis (x,y,angle to x, ...)

## Remarks
* The axisymmetric formulation uses the y-axis as rotational axis, so the radius extents along the x-axis.
* The code outlined below is also compatible to 3D, so you don't have to differentiate between 2D and 3D. It does no harm to your 3D computation.
* Obviously the code design is far from optimal. We recompute the same values multiple times and even slightly slow down a standard 3D computaton for which none of the below steps are necessary. The focus is currently on usability and comprehensibility. This means that the relevant functions return the usual 3D output if you call them with dim=3
* Axisymmetry is "exact" in tangential direction. We utilise no discretisation in this "third dimension". Hence, keep in mind that when you try to compare the axisymmetric computation with a 3D model, the latter needs a fairly fine spatial discretisation in the tangential direction to converge to the axisymmetric model. But be aware of the errors due to the numerical integration that only arises for axisym ("Numerical integration in the axisymmetric finite element formulation", Clayton&Rencis).
* Plane strain results can be verified by 3D computations. However, it is hardly possible to make the 3D model thick enough (extension in the third dimension) to represent the plane strain state. We were able to obtain the best results by applying symmetry constraints on both z-planes, which forces the model to acquire no normal strains in the thickness direction ("plane strain").

## Plane strain
The plane strain case is handled straightforward. We expand the 2D strain tensor by the 3D components, which are all zero. Then we input this 3D strain tensor into a 3D material model and compute the full 3D stress tensor, which is, for instance, needed to compute the true von Mises stress (Exception: For elasticity the out-of-plane stress can directly be computed from Hooke's law). We extract only the relevant 2D components for the computation of the residuum and tangent.

To implement this you only require steps 1, 2 and 3 as outlined below for the more general case of axial symmetry. Because plane strain is a special case of axial symmetry, you can kill two birds with one stone by implementing steps 1 to 6 (compatible to 2D plane strain, axisymmetry and 3D).

## Axial symmetry
### Background
To start with, we have to integrate over a circular domain as outlined for deal.ii here: [mail-archive-msg08250](https://www.mail-archive.com/dealii@googlegroups.com/msg08250.html) (and in the following messages). In short: We have to multiply the standard JxW-value by the factor (2 * pi * r), where r is the radial coordinate of the current quadrature point. As a consequence, the results we obtain, e.g. the global force acting on the loaded face, represents the force that acts on the full model (the 2D cross section rotated by the above factor (2 * pi) producing the 360Â° model). If you leave the factor of (2 * pi) out of the integration, your results correspond to a section of 1 rad of the full model.

Besides this minor addition, the following major extensions are needed in the assembly routine when mechanical problems (displacement, deformation) shall be solved that use kinematics (e.g. small strain, deformation gradient).

The 2D displacement gradient computed from the displacement field (components u and w) needs to be expanded by the normal strain eps_theta. The latter is, in contrast to 2D plane strain, non-zero as for instance explained by Petr Krysl in ["A pragmatic Introduction to the Finite Element Method"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Pragmatic-Introduction-to-the-Finite-Element-for-Krysl/1a1e70b1dae4e971ba21af396f54b7fbaac14ffd) in chapter 15.3 (excerpt in \images folder) or sketched in the figure below.

To sum up, radial displacements u_r produce tangential strains eps_theta = u_r / r.

Additionally, the tangential stress contributes to the residual, which results from the gradient operator in cylindrical coordinates. Please note that cylindrical coordinates and derivatives in this frame can be very non-intuitive and require careful consideration. A complete derivation can be found in the pdf xxx on page 1 and 2 with some additional theory on page 5-10.
	
This renders the axisymmetric weak form as follows (in the spatial configuration, for details see pdf xxx):
	
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\int_{\mathcal{B}_t}&space;\nabla_\text{2D}&space;\boldsymbol{N}^\text{2D}&space;:&space;\boldsymbol{\sigma}^\text{2D}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{r}&space;N^r&space;\sigma_{\theta&space;\theta}&space;\text{d}&space;v&space;=&space;0" title="\int_{\mathcal{B}_t} \nabla_\text{2D} \boldsymbol{N}^\text{2D} : \boldsymbol{\sigma}^\text{2D} + \frac{1}{r} N^r \sigma_{\theta \theta} \text{d} v = 0" />
	
The second term comes from the axialsymmetry and needs to be added to the residual. Alternatively, also the gradient operator could be appended by this contribution as it is done for the axisymmetric B-matrix (compare book yyy).
	
### Small strains

This strain in the third dimension must be inserted as the out-of-plane component in the expanded 2D strain tensor as shown in the following figure.

@todo add this figure

#### Steps:

1. This can be done by calling the following function after the strain tensor eps_n1 was constructed (e.g. as symmetric part of the gradient of the deformations) and before calling the material model. The latter needs to handle the 3D case (3D strain and stress tensors) and must be called with the expanded strain 'eps_n1_3D'. (Everything located inside the loop over the quadrature points)

@todo explain parameter.type_2D and add enumerator to the handling_2D.h header, add enumerator axiSym instead of type_2D in input

@todo change fe_values_ref to ..._u, if possible

	SymmetricTensor<2,3> eps_n1_3D = prepare_strain<dim> (eps_n1, type_2D, fe_values_ref, current_solution, k);

2. Call the 3D material model with the properly prepared 3D strain tensor.

		{eps_n1_3D, history_n} -> material model -> {stress_3D, Tangent_3D, history_tmp}

3. Extract the 2D tangent modulus 'Tangent' from the full 3D quantity. Moreover, the 2D stress tensor can be extracted, which is, for instance, needed for the residuum. For (dim=3) the 'extract_dim' functions simply return the input argument unchanged. Call:

		SymmetricTensor<2,dim> Tangent = extract_dim<dim> (Tangent_3D);
		SymmetricTensor<2,dim> stress = extract_dim<dim> (stress_3D);
		
4. Extract from the full 3D tangent modulus 'Tangent_3D' (fourth order tensor) the components that contain the dependency of the stress tensor on the out-of-plane strain eps_theta summarised in 'Tangent_theta', 'd_stress_thetatheta_d_strain' and 'Tangent_theta_theta'. Call:

		const SymmetricTensor<2,dim> Tangent_theta = extract_theta<dim> (Tangent_3D);
		cnnst SymmetricTensor<2,dim> d_stress_thetatheta_d_strain = extract_theta_secondPair<dim>( Tangent_3D );
		const double Tangent_theta_theta = Tangent_3D[2][2][2][2];

5. Modify the JxW-value for the axial symmetric domain (see factor 2 * pi * r above) by calling

		const double JxW = get_JxW<dim> (type_2D, fe_values_ref, k);
	
6. Determine the undeformed radius 'R' and radial displacement 'u_r' for the current quadrature point 'k'
	
		const double R = get_radial_x<dim>(fe_values_ref,k);
		const double u_r  = get_radial_u<dim>(current_solution,fe_values_ref,k);

7. In the loop over the dofs 'i': Compute the value of the radial shape_function
	
		const double shape_fnc_i_u = fe_values_ref[u_fe].value(i,k)[enums::u];
	
8. Add the contribution from the axialsymmetry to the residual
	
		 cell_rhs(i) -= get_axisym_residual_contribution( R, u_r, stress_3D, shape_fnc_i_u, JxW );
	
9. In the loop over the dofs 'j' (to assemble the cell_matrix(i,j)) compute the theta contribution and add it to the linearisation of the stress tensor (typically 'Tangent * sym_shape_gradient_wrt_ref_config_j')

		 dS_theta_axisym = get_dS_theta_axisym_fstrain( Tangent_theta, fe_values_ref, current_solution, k, j );

		 double shape_fnc_j_u = fe_values_ref[u_fe].value(j,k)[enums::u];

		 cell_matrix(i,j) += get_axisym_linearisation_contribution_sstrain( zzz);


### Finite strains
The steps are almost identical to the previous small strain scenario.

Replace step 1 by

	Tensor<2,3> DefoGradient_3D = prepare_DefoGrad<dim> (DeformationGradient, type_2D, fe_values_ref, current_solution, k);

to prepare the second order 'DeformationGradient' with dim-components obtaining 'DefoGradient_3D'.

Secondly, to compute the tangent contribution in step 6 we also require the current solution, hence we call the function

	SymmetricTensor<2,dim> Tangent_axisym = get_Tangent_axisym_addOn_fstrain( Tangent_theta, fe_values_ref, current_solution, k, j );

The following assembly snippet shall give you an idea how to incorporate the tangent contribution into your stiffness matrix. The axisymmetry typically contributes to a linearisation when you derive something with respect to the deformation gradient (or the small strain tensor above). In the example below, you can imagine how the stress 'stress_S' also depends on the theta-theta component of the deformation gradient or the right Cauchy-Green tensor. Hence, this dependency needs to be captured by the tangent. So the linearisation of the stress contains besides the standard contribution also the axisymmetric addon. The latter contains in essence the derivative of the stress tensor with respect to the radial displacements "chained" as

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{S}}{\partial&space;u_r}&space;=&space;\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{S}}{\partial&space;C_\theta}&space;\cdot&space;\frac{\partial&space;C_\theta}{\partial&space;u_r}&space;=&space;\boldsymbol{C}_\theta&space;\cdot&space;\frac{\partial&space;C_\theta}{\partial&space;u_r}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{S}}{\partial&space;u_r}&space;=&space;\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{S}}{\partial&space;C_\theta}&space;\cdot&space;\frac{\partial&space;C_\theta}{\partial&space;u_r}&space;=&space;\boldsymbol{C}_\theta&space;\cdot&space;\frac{\partial&space;C_\theta}{\partial&space;u_r}" title="\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{S}}{\partial u_r} = \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{S}}{\partial C_\theta} \cdot \frac{\partial C_\theta}{\partial u_r} = \boldsymbol{C}_\theta \cdot \frac{\partial C_\theta}{\partial u_r}" /></a>

! Don't interchange the scalar C_theta (theta-theta component of the 3D right Cauchy-Green tensor) with the second order tensor C_theta containing the derivatives with respect to the theta-theta strain entry.

This setup also enables us to provide the axisymmetric tangent addon for various linearisation by simply calling the 'get_Tangent_axisym_addOn_fstrain' function with the respective tangent contribution C_theta.

@todo add scan of sketched summary with setup of 3D axisym defoGradient, where F_theta = 1 + u_r / r

@todo add a note and check how things change when the derivatives are no longer wrt to the right C-G tensor
	
@todo Clean the code, currently get_axisym_linearisation_contribution always adds the contribution even for 3D or plane strain (requires a protective if-clause, etc.)

	SymmetricTensor<2,dim> deltaRCG = 2. * symmetrize( transpose(grad_X_N_u_j) * DeformationGradient );
	SymmetricTensor<2,dim> deltaS = Tangent * deltaRCG;
	
	SymmetricTensor<2,dim> dS_theta_axisym = get_dS_theta_axisym_fstrain( Tangent_theta, fe_values_ref, current_solution, k, j );
	double shape_fnc_j_u = fe_values_ref[u_fe].value(j,k)[enums::u];
 	cell_matrix(i,j) += get_axisym_linearisation_contribution( R, u_r, stress_S_3D, deltaRCG, d_S_thetatheta_d_C, Tangent_theta_theta, shape_fnc_i_u, shape_fnc_j_u, JxW );
	
	cell_matrix(i,j) += (
				/*geometrical contribution:*/
				symmetrize( transpose(shape_gradient_wrt_ref_config_i) * shape_gradient_wrt_ref_config_j ) * stress_S
				+
				/*material contribution:*/
				(
				   symmetrize( transpose(DeformationGradient) * shape_gradient_wrt_ref_config_i )
				   /*linearisation of the stress tensor \a stress_S:*/
				   * (
					deltaS
					+
					dS_theta_axisym
				     )
				)
			     )
			     * JxW;
